Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer\\'s \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he\\'s legally an adult: \"I just think I\\'m going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

      "4 Dr Nurpur Mittal, 33, took £130 cash from Kelly Wissenden’s purse after the mother-of-two left the consultation room to obtain a specimen from her nine-month-old son Zaio Headley.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
      "5 Miss Wissenden, 29, said she thought it was ‘odd’ when she returned and saw Dr Mittal ‘fiddling around’ in her bag, which she had left on her child’s buggy in the doctor’s room.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "6 But she only realised the money was missing when she checked the purse as she left White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover, Kent.\n",
      "7 It emerged in court that Dr Mittal had previously been given a ‘fiscal warning’ for shoplifting in Scotland.\n",
      "8 She now faces the possibility of being struck off the medical register as she will be ordered to appear before a General Medical Council disciplinary board.\n",
      "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",

      "12 ‘A patient has the right to expect that the last person in the world who would steal from them was  a doctor.’ The court heard that Miss Wissenden was intending to use the money to pay for repairs to her car.\n",
      "13 Andrew Forsyth, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Wissenden later described seeing Dr Mittal fiddling around near the change bag and the buggy, looking very flustered.\n",
      "14 'She thought it strange at the time but didn't say anything.'\n",
      "15 After checking her bag outside and finding the money had gone missing, she returned inside the surgery and told the receptionist Christine Button about her cash disappearing from her purse.\n",
      "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
      "16 Dr Mittal stole the cash from Kelly Wissenden, pictured, when she attended an appointment with her son Zaio Headley at the White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover .\n",

      "17 She said they searched the doctor's room and the changing area where they had taken her son but did not find anything.\n",
      "18 However, after following Dr Mittal's advice, they returned a short while later and found the cash on the floor of the changing room.\n",
      "19 Miss Wissenden phoned the police later that day to report the doctor and what had happened.\n",
      "20 The court was told Dr Mittal phoned Miss Wissenden later that evening asking her to withdraw the theft allegation.\n",
      "21 Dr Mittal, from Shepherdswell, near Dover, was convicted of theft by a jury last month after she had denied the charge.\n",
      "22 Before sentencing Dr Mittal, he asked for a report about her mental state as he could not understand why someone who 'probably receives a healthy salary' would want to steal £130.\n",
      "23 The theft took place at White Cliff's Medical Centre in Dover, pictured, and Dr Mittal's name has been removed from the website as a list of doctors practicing at the centre .\n",
      "24 The court also heard yesterday that Dr Mittal was married but her husband is filing for divorce from her.\n",
      "25 Her name has been taken off the website list of doctors practising at the White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover.\n",
      "26 Yesterday the practice manager at the medical centre said they did not want to comment.\n",
      "27 After the court hearing, Miss Wissenden, who works as a stewardess for P&O Ferries, said: 'It's really shocking, it's horrible.\n",
      "28 'I put my faith in her, my son's life was in her hands and she stole from me.\n",
      "29 'It's been such a stressful time.\n",
      "30 The reaction you get when you tell people is 'really, but she's a doctor?'.\n",
